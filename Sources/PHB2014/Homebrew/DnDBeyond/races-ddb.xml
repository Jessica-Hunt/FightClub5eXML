      <text>Canus are humanoids with certain dog-like features. This includes almost always ears and a tail, and rarely furred forearms and hands. The specifics of these traits change with sub-race, or in the harsher side of their heritage, "breeds". Hellhounds have darker furs, and fire seems to burn in their eyes. Servants have white fur nearly all the time, but sometimes a mutation will cause them to have grey hair, their eyes look quite normal.

      <name>History</name>
      <text>The Canus are a result of ancestors with lycanthropy giving birth to children with regular humans. Since lycanthropes are considered monsters, their children were considered freaks of nature, a mixture of monster and human that shouldn't exist. That is until one was allowed to grow up. This singular creature was docile and friendly, had little intelligence and seemed like a domestic wolf. That is when they became simple pets. However, once they started to become more and more human-like, it has become a question of if they can be given human rights. </text>
